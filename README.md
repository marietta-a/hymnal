## 📖 About The App

The Hymnal app is a modern, feature-rich, and easy-to-use digital version of the official Catholic hymnal authorized by the Bishops of the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province. Built with Flutter, this app provides a seamless and customizable experience for the faithful, allowing for easy access to the complete collection of hymns for Mass, liturgical seasons, and personal devotion.

Our goal is to foster "religious singing by the people" and encourage active participation in worship, all from the convenience of your mobile device.

## ✨ Features

-   **📚 Complete Hymnal:** Access all hymns, neatly organized into their official categories (Entrance, Offertory, Communion, Our Lady, etc.).
-   **🔍 Powerful Search:** Instantly find any hymn by searching for its **title** or **number**. The list updates in real-time as you type.
-   **❤️ Favorites:** Mark your most-loved hymns with a single tap for quick and easy access from a dedicated Favorites tab.
-   **🎨 Customizable Experience:** Tailor the app to your reading comfort with our settings panel:
    -   **Light & Dark Mode:** Switch between a beautiful light theme and a battery-saving, eye-friendly dark theme. Your choice is saved automatically.
    -   **Adjustable Fonts:** Independently change the **font size** and **font family** for both hymn titles and lyrics.
-   **✨ Modern & Clean UI:** A beautiful and intuitive interface built with Material 3, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
-   **🔐 Offline Access:** All hymns are stored on your device, so you can access them anytime, anywhere, even without an internet connection.
