Special theme for glad thanksgiving\nIs the quick’ning and the living\nBread today before thee set:\n\n4. From His hands of old partaken,\nAs we know, by faith unshaken,\nWhere the twelve at supper met.\n\n5. Full and clear ring out thy chanting,\nJoy nor sweetest grace be wanting,\nFrom thy heart let praises burst:\n\n6. For today the feast is holden,\nWhen the institution olden\nOf that supper was rehearsed.\n\n7. Here the new law’s new oblation,\nBy the new King’s revelation,\nEnds the form of ancient rite:\n\n8. Now the new the old effaceth,\nTruth away the shadow chaseth,\nLight dispels the gloom of night.\n\n9. What he did at supper seated,\nChrist ordained to be repeated,\nHis memorial ne’er to cease:\n\n10. And his rule for guidance taken,\nBread and wine we hallow, making\nThus our sacrifice of peace.\n\n11. This the truth each Christian learneth,\nBread into His flesh He turneth,\nTo His precious blood the wine:\n\n12. Sight hath fail’dk, nor thought conceiveth,\nBut a dauntless faith believeth,\nResting on a pow’r divine.\n\n13. Here beneath this signs are hidden\nPriceless things so sense forbidden;\nSigns, not things are all we see:\n\n14. Blood is poured and flesh is broken,\nYet in either wondrous token\nChrist entire we know to be.\n\n15. Whose of this food partaketh,\nRendeth not the Lord nor breaketh\nChrist is whole to all that taste:\n\n16. Thousands are, as one, recievers,\nOne as thousands of believers,\nEats of Him who cannot waste.\n\n17. Bad and good the feast are sharing,\nOf what diverse dooms preparing,\nEndless death or endless life.\n\n18. Life to this, to those damnation,\nSee how like participation\nIs with unlike issues rife.\n\n19. When the sacrament is broken,\nDoubt not, but believe ‘tis spoken,\nThat each sever’d outward token\n\n20. Doth the very whole contain.\nNought the precious gift divideth,\nBreaking but the sign betideth\nJesus still the same abideth,\nStill unbroken doth remain.\n\n21. Lo! The angels’ food is given\nTo the pilgrim who has striven;\nSee the children’s bread from heaven,\nWhich on dusk may not be spent.\n\n22. Truth the ancient types fulfilling,\nIsaac bound, a victim willing,\nPaschal lamb, in life blood spilling,\nManna to the fathers sent.\n\n23. Very bread, good shepherd, tend us,\nJesu, of thy love befriend us,\nThou refresh us, thou defend us,\nThine eternal goodness send us\nIn the land of life to see.\n\n24. Thou who all things canst and knowest,\nWho on earth such food bestowest,\nGrant us with thy saints though lowest,\nWhere the heav’nly feast thou showest,\nFellow heirs and guests to be.
